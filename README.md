### User
#### Login Credentials:
username: `user`  
password: `user`

Please note that the registration page (`/registration`) does not yet make a real account.

#### Features:

- The landing page (`/`) explains to newcomers what the site is about. Its header contains a link back to the landing page and a link to the login page.
- On the login page (`/login`), the user can input their username and password, and log in. If they don’t have an account, they can click register (`/registration`) and create an account.
- After logging in, the user is taken to the homepage (`/home`) where they can see a list of current posts, filter these posts by offer/request, sort the posts by location, create a new post, and search for users/posts by username, first and/or last name, and post title. At the top is a link to the homepage, a search box, a link to the user’s inbox, a link to the user’s profile page, and a logout button.
    - Clicking a post’s arrow button will expand the post, and you can read the full description of the post, go back, or click on the poster’s name to view their profile. 
        - If it’s your own post, you can also remove the post. Posts that you remove become permanently hidden from the public and are viewable only by you on your profile.
        - If it’s another person's post, you can also report the post or send the poster a message. Reported posts are hidden from you for the rest of your session. 
    - Creating a new post will take you to a screen where you can input the title, body, type of request, and location and post it.
- On the Inbox page (`/inbox`), you can see all of your past messages and can message another user about their post. You also have the ability to report another person’s message.
- The profile page (`/profile`) allows you to see a user’s info along with any posts they have made. 
    - If it’s your own profile, you also have the option to change any of your info. 
    - If it’s another person’s profile, you can click Message to message them, which will bring up the past messages you have with this person or start a new conversation with them.
- The setting page (`/setting`) allows you to edit your profile information. You can change your first and last name, biography, and location. 
    - Your first and last name, and location must not be empty. 
    - You can also change your password but you must know your current password for safety reasons and must confirm the new password you entered to prevent typing mistakes.



### Admin

#### Login Instructions and Credentials:
The admin login page can be found at `/admin`
